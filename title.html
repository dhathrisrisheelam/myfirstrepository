<font color="navy"><i>My hobbies and interests are cooking and reading books which I pursue in my leisure time.</i></font>
<p><h3>I enjoy cooking various types of dishes and this habit I learn from my mom. She cooks delicious food. And now whenever I cook food in my spare time , I receive the positive comments  from my parents , my brother and my grandparents on my dish. So I have planned to start a new hotel in my coming years .</p>
I  love reading books. Especially mystery novels which are very engaging and have an interesting plot lines. My favourite author is Agatha Christie. She is an England English novel writer. One of her famous novels is “Murder on the orient express”(d<sup>2</sup>*d<sub>2</sub>). It describes the mora laws vs.  written laws.
<p>Its all about my interests, hobbies and my future startups. My conclusion is :
